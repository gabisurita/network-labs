This repository contains experiments and tutorials develop during the computer networks laboratory (EA080)
at University of Campinas under supervision of [Professor Christian Esteve Rothenberg](https://github.com/chesteve).

The content is divided between tutorials and reports.
Tutorials are in a Markdown format and should be easy to reproduce, with most steps and resources are available in this repository inside the [examples](examples/) and [captures](captures/) directories.
Reports have the content developed during the course on a more traditional academic report format, they are also in PDF and their examples are not attached.
In order to reproduce the steps in the tutorials, start with [Mininet Installation](setup.md).
